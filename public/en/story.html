                <h2>Our Beginning</h2>
                <p>Papa Remo Beach was established in 1997 by Remo Lenzi, an Italian with a passion for the Kenyan coast. The story begins when Remo first visited Watamu and fell in love with its pristine beaches and warm community.</p>
                <p>Determined to create something special, Remo lived in a tent for a year to fully immerse himself in the African experience and understand the local culture. This dedication and respect for the environment and community became the foundation of Papa Remo Beach.</p>

                <h2>Growth and Evolution</h2>
                <p>What began as a simple family hut, where my dad, my sister, the rest of the family, and I would go to relax and walk on the beach, transformed over time into something special. In the first photo, from the early 2000s, you can still feel that simple, familiar atmosphere. Over time, when my dad returned to Italy, I took over the project, turning that place full of memories into what Papa Remo is today: a restaurant, a beach club, an event venue, and much more.</p>
                <p>Papa Remo has grown while staying true to its roots, offering authentic experiences and preserving the natural beauty of Watamu. The famous Saturday beach parties, with local DJs, continue to bring together residents and tourists in a vibrant atmosphere. A family story that has become a beloved destination.</p>
